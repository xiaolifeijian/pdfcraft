| `sha-abc1234` | Specific commit |

#### Option 2: Build from Source with Docker Compose

If you want to build from source or need to modify the code:

> ⚠️ **Note**: This method requires cloning the repository first.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PDFCraftTool/pdfcraft.git
cd pdfcraft

# Development mode (with hot reload)
docker compose --profile dev up

# Production mode (static build + Nginx)
docker compose --profile prod up --build
```

- Production: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs tests using Vitest.

## 🚀 Production Deployment Guide

PDFCraft is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`), which means it can be deployed to any service that supports static website hosting without requiring a Node.js server.

> 📖 **For comprehensive deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Quick Start

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   All static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

2. **Deploy to your preferred platform:**
   - **Vercel** (Recommended): `vercel --prod`
   - **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=out`
   - **GitHub Pages**: Push to `main` branch (uses GitHub Actions)
   - **Cloudflare Pages**: `wrangler pages deploy out`
   - **Docker + Nginx**: `docker compose --profile prod up --build`

### Deployment Files Included

| File | Platform |
|------|----------|
| `vercel.json` | Vercel |
| `netlify.toml` | Netlify |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | GitHub Pages |
| `public/_headers` | Cloudflare Pages / Netlify |
| `docker-compose.yml` + `nginx.conf` | Docker / Self-hosted |
| `.htaccess` | Apache |

### Important Notes
- **Headers Configuration**: Security and caching headers are pre-configured in all deployment files.
- **Image Optimization**: Static export uses `images: { unoptimized: true }`.
- **WASM Support**: All deployment configs include proper MIME types for WebAssembly.

### Verify Deployment
After deployment, please check the following features to ensure everything is working correctly:
- Multi-language routing (e.g., `/en`, `/zh`)
- Tool page loading
- WebAssembly (PDF processing) functionality
